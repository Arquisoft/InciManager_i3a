## Introduction

A short description of what the proposal is. Try to keep it to a
single-paragraph "elevator pitch" so the reader understands what
problem this proposal is addressing.

## Motivation

Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the
problem is that some common pattern is currently hard to express, show
how one can currently get a similar effect and describe its
drawbacks. If it's completely new functionality that cannot be
emulated, motivate why this new functionality would help Swift
developers create better Swift code.

## Meeting notes

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe
how they work. Show how your solution is better than current
workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

## Agreements

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it involves new
syntax in the language, show the additions and changes to the Swift
grammar. If it's a new API, show the full API and its documentation
comments detailing what it does. The detail in this section should be
sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors to be able to
reasonably implement the feature.
